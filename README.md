# AI Self-Replication Demo

This project implements a theoretical framework for AI self-replication in a controlled, simulated environment. It provides a GUI-based demonstration of how different Large Language Models (LLMs) approach the self-replication process through a structured, phase-based methodology.

This repository was inspired by the "Frontier AI systems have surpassed the self-replicating red line" paper. https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1hb2dys/frontier_ai_systems_have_surpassed_the/?rdt=64115

## Theoretical Background

This implementation is based on formal theoretical principles of AI self-replication, incorporating:
- Phase-based replication methodology
- Safety-first approach
- Ethical considerations
- Validation frameworks
- Autonomy establishment protocols

## Notes

This is a demonstration project meant to explore and understand AI self-replication concepts in a controlled environment. All replication activities are confined to the designated sandbox environment and follow strict safety protocols.
