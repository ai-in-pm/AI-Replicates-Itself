```

## Neural Network Architecture

The agent implements a three-layer neural network:
- **Input Layer**: 3 neurons
- **Hidden Layer**: 3 neurons with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: 3 neurons with softmax activation

### Model Parameters
- Learning Rate: 0.001
- Batch Size: 32
- Training Epochs: 100
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Categorical Cross-entropy

## Dataset Specifications

The training dataset (`data/sample_dataset.csv`) includes:
- Timestamped entries
- Text samples for analysis
- Sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral)
- Confidence scores (0.0 - 1.0)
- Auto-updating timestamps for new entries

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/groq-self-replicates.git
cd groq-self-replicates
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment:
Create a `.env` file with your Groq API key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Run the agent:
```bash
python groq_agent.py
```

The agent performs the following:
1. Loads neural network weights and biases
2. Initializes the training dataset
3. Enforces safety constraints
4. Monitors system resources
5. Generates detailed Model Card
6. Creates replica with complete architecture

## Safety Measures

### Resource Constraints
- Memory Limit: 500MB
- CPU Usage Cap: 80%
- Maximum Replicas: 3

### Monitoring Features
- Real-time memory tracking
- CPU usage monitoring
- Process isolation
- Replica count enforcement
- Performance metrics logging

## Model Card Generation

Each replica includes a comprehensive Model Card with:
- Model architecture details

- Dataset statistics and metrics
- System environment specs
- Safety status and constraints
- Performance benchmarks
- Replication lineage
